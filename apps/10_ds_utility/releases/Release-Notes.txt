VERSION 24.2.1 - October 2024

Bug fixing:
- Added explicit AUTHID DEFINER to all packages to avoid warnings during vulnerability scan.
- Record sequence number representing the extraction generation was not correctly computed.

VERSION 24.2 - August 2024

New Features:
- Added support for FF3 Format-Preserving Encryption algorithm.

VERSION 24.1.2 - August 2024

Bug fixing:
- Fixed vulnerabilities identified by Fortify Static Code Analyzer.

VERSION 24.1.1 - August 2024

Changes:
- Required runtime privileges are now checked when main package is invoked.

Bug fixing:
- Table checksum was wrong when default unit for char column length was CHAR.
  Unit of char column length is now explicitly set to CHAR for all columns.

VERSION 24.1 - June 2024

New Features:
- New encrypt/decrypt_integer() functions to encrypt/decrypt integers
  within a given range of integer values.

Changes:
- encrypt/decrypt_number() functions now accept negative numbers.
  Result was previously NULL.
- Data sets have been updated with free to use data + source documented.

Bug Fixing:
- n/a

VERSION 24.0 - April 2024

New Features:
- The entire data set configuration can now be shown on Graphviz diagrams.
- New option to enable/disable encryption of tokenized values at mask level.

Changes:
- Demo scripts changed + new demonstration guide written in markdown language.
- Procedure handle_data_set() has been renamed to transport_data_set().
- Procedure include_path() has been renamed to execute_degpl().
- Data capture mode codes have been renamed.

Bug Fixing:
- Update statements where sometime incorrectly generated in refresh mode (UI).
- Data generation and data masking were not working when the tool was not installed in the same schema.
- Data set backup demo script was not working properly.

VERSION 23.4 - December 2023

New Features:
- Added visualisation of data sets using GraphViz graphs (dot language).
- Added data set configuration using DEGPL (Data Extraction and Generation Path Language).

Bug Fixing:
- Extract count was sometimes incorrect (records found via different paths were counted several times).
- Extract type parameter passed to include_referential_cons() was used for added tables instead of added constraints.
- Optimisation consisting to transform useless P-constraint to N-constraint was not entirely correct.
- For GEN data sets, number of generated records (extract_count) was incorrect in some cases.

VERSION 23.3

New Features:
- Added tokenization as an additional data masking technique

Changes:
- Specific implementation of relocation of identifiers was replaced by data masking techniques:
  . Id shifting: replaced with SQL masking; column ds_tables.id_shift_value dropped.
  . Sequence: replaced with SEQUENCE masking; column ds_tables.sequence_name dropped.
  . Table ds_identifiers now linked to ds_masks.msk_id instead of ds_tables.table_id.
  . Procedure delete_data_set_identifiers() replaced with delete_identifiers().
  . Added differ_masking=[true|false] option to perform old/new id mapping in target schema.
- Specific implementation to force a value depending on operation (I/U/D) replaced with SQL masking:
  . Procedure force_column_value() removed.
  . Added support for INSERTING, UPDATING, DELETING and SELECTING keywords in SQL expressions
    These keywords are replaced with 1=1 (TRUE) or 1=0 (FALSE) depending on current operation.
- Improved performance of SQL masking when no other column is referenced in the SQL expression:
  . A join is no more necessary between FK and PK tables; SQL expression is just copied over.
- Removed SYSPER project specific code (obsolete anyway).
- Added "p_raise_error_when_no_update" parameter to all "update_xxx_properties()" procedures.
  . By default, raise an exception when no property was updated.
- Added "p_raise_error_when_no_insert" parameter to some "insert_xxx()" procedures.
  . By default, raise an exception when no record was inserted.
- SQL mask is no more applied to NULL values unless option "mask_null_values=true" is set.
- The following deprecated procedures have been removed: copy_data_set(), move_data_set(),
  handle_data_set_via_script(), export_data_set_via_script(), delete_data_set_via_script(),
  export_data_set_via_db_link().

Bug Fixing:
- Encryption and/or decryption was not working properly when performed through database links
- Extraction as XML was not always working properly (Java null pointer exception)
- Extraction as scripts was not always working properly (rowid was prefixed with table alias twice)
- An error was raised when a table alias extracted from uk/pk was an Oracle reserved keyword.
  The full list from v$reserved_words is now checked instead of a few keywords.
- Error ORA-06502 was raised when passing a seed value with special characters.
  The problem was fixed by converting the seed value to the US7ASCII character set.

BUG FIXING in 23.2.1
- There was a SQL syntax error (double column alias prefix) in generated scripts when masking SQL expression was containing ROWID
- Propagation of PK to optional FKs was not working properly (inner join was generated in the query instead of left outer join)
- An encryption key different from the one defined by end-user was used when transporting encrypted data via database link

CHANGES in 23.2.1
- Added deleted_flag in ds_masks to logically delete records (for internal use)
- Added the possibility to add a ROWID# column in generated views to more easily compare masked and unmasked data
  (new "p_include_rowid" parameter in create_views())
- Shuffling, encryption and PK masking propagation is now supported when storing data as XML
